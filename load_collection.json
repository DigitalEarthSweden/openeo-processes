    "description": "Loads a collection from the current back-end by its id and returns it as processable data cube. The data that is added to the data cube can be filtered by an expression so that every part of the data that the expression returns `true` for is included in the data cube.\n\n*Remarks:**\n\n* The bands (and all dimensions that specify nominal dimension values) are expected to be ordered as specified in the metadata.\n* If `expression` is not specified this would imply that the whole data set is expected to be loaded. Due to the immensive size of several data sets this may be optimized by back-ends to only load the data that is actually required after evaluation subsequent processes such as filters. This means that the pixel values should be processed only after the data has been limited to the required extents and as a consequence also to a manageable size.",
