    "description": "Aggregates statistics for one or more geometries (e.g. zonal statistics for polygons) over the spatial dimensions. This process passes two values to the reducer. In contrast, ``aggregate_spatial()`` passes a list of values.\n\n- For polygons, the process considers all pixels for which the point at the pixel center intersects with the corresponding polygon (as defined in the Simple Features standard by the OGC).\n- For points and lines (line strings), the process considers all the closest pixel centers.\n\nThus, pixels may be part of multiple geometries and be part of multiple aggregations.\n\nThe data cube must have been reduced to only contain two raster dimensions and a third dimension the values are aggregated for, for example the temporal dimension to get a time series. Otherwise this process fails with the `TooManyDimensions` error.\n\nThe number of total and valid pixels is returned together with the calculated values.",
