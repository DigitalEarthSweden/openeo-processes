# Zonal Statistics (POC Use Case 3)

This example computes time series of zonal (regional) statistics of Sentinel 2 imagery over user-specified polygons.

This process graph is meant to be used as batch job or can be lazy evaluated. It returns a JSON file with the computed results.

This process graph assumes the dataset is called `Sentinel-2`. The temporal extent covered is January 2017, an arbitrary spatial extent was chosen and it uses band `B8` for the computations. Please note that we still need to remove (reduce) the spectral dimension from the data cube (see node `reduce1`) as removing all bands except one still keeps the spectral dimension for the bands.

Only a single GeoJSON polygon is specified, which fully covers the spatial extent specified in `load_collection`. We compute the mean for the values in the polygon.

## Result

We haven't yet clearly specified the output format for this process. Therefore, the results may vary between back-ends. Executing a similar process graph on Google Earth Engine gives the following results:

```
{
  "result": 6303.442644344102,
  "result_pixel_count": null,
  "result_invalid_count: null
}
```
