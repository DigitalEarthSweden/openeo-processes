    "description": "Applies a reducer to a data cube dimension by collapsing all the input values along the specified dimension into an output value computed by the reducer.\n\nThe reducer must be a callable process (or a set of processes) that accepts by default array as input. The process can also work on two values by setting `binary` to `true`. The reducer must computes a single or multiple return values of the same type as the input values. Multiple values must be wrapped in an array. An example for a process returning a single value is ``median()``. In this case the specified dimension would be removed. If a callback such as ``extrema()`` returns multiple values, a new dimension with the specified name in `target_dimension` is created (see the parameter description for more information).\n\nNominal values can be reduced too, but need to be mapped. For example date strings to numeric timestamps since 1970 etc.",
