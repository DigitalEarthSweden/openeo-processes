    "description": "Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI is computed as *(nir - red) / (nir + red)*.\n\nThe `data` parameter expects a raster data cube with two bands that have the common names `red` and `nir` assigned. The process returns a raster data cube with two bands being replaced with a new band that holds the computed values. For ease of use the newly created band should be named `ndvi`.\n\nThis process is very similar to the `normalized_difference` process, but determines the bands automatically based on the common name (`red`/`nir`) specified in the metadata.",
